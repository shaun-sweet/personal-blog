## Hi there
Stay a while and listen!  So a little bit about me and my background just to give a bit of context surrounding any writing of mine.  I'm a javascript developer professionally and do a decent amount of exploring in the vast, endless black hole we know as the blackhole more commonly known as the javascript ecosystem.  It goes forever!  I am a person who *really* loves exploring these ideas.  Subsequently, a lot of what you'll read here, will be about javascript!  As a disclaimer, I could rant about really anything.  I will however attempt to keep it focused on development as a whole so there is at least *some* formal scope :D.
