According to [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org)


###JAMstack: noun \’jam-stak’\ 
Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

*what does this mean?!*

Why don't I just explain start with each letter of the acryonam "JAM stack".  Shall we?

Well its refreshingly simple which is kind of the glory of it.  We are taking a step back from the vast world of cutting edge front end javascript and going back to the basics.  

JAM stack works by leveraging the power of modern javascript tooling, specifically - webpack.  

API's.  

And content - markup.
